Team members are expected to attend scheduled meetings, practice punctuality, and inform
 and discuss any lateness or absence. Absence or tardiness should be communicated in 
advance of any team/group activity. Team members should contribute to meetings to the best
 of their ability and play an active and engaged role in team proceedings.

Team members are encouraged to acknowledge and accept their own, and others, limitations
while still contributing to team goals. Team members should feel able to ask for help 
themselves and assist others who have asked for help. All team members must respect other
memberâ€™s ability levels fostering a positive, non-judgemental and supportive environment

Team members must work collaboratively, share their code, work and sources. Team members
